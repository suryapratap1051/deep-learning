# deep-learning
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that aims to emulate the learning process of the human brain to analyze and extract meaningful patterns from vast amounts of data. It utilizes artificial neural networks, which are composed of interconnected layers of nodes called neurons, to process and interpret information.
